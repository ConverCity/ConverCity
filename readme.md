## Convercity
### A 311 Converstaion Platform

### Employed Techology

#### Larvel 5.0.1 PHP Framework

While in the hackathon/prototype mindset we used Laravel to provide a rapid development environmenet where we could rely heavily on it's MVC framework and RESTful controller methodology.

#### Twilio

We used Twiliio through it's API to both send incoming text messages into the application and process sending replies.

#### D3.js

The D3js library has been employed so far in just one element of Convercity, a word cloud of raw text responses to question. However, as the app continues to be developed we intend to use D3 heavily to provide data visualization and mapping.

#### JQuery

JQuery is used throughout the interface to facilitate AJAX calls.

#### Bootstrap by Twitter

For prototyping we utilized Twitter's Bootstrap library for the UI


### Existing functionality

#### Natural language interpertation
